# Pathfinding On Map

## Brief Introduction
- This is a project concentrated mainly on pathfinding algorithms on a map, including Dijkstra & A*, as well as the implementation of Welsh-Powell graph coloring algorithm on a map.
## Tools
- *OpenStreetMap*
  - [Website](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
  - Nearly all the city/nodes/ways information is downloaded from the *OpenStreetMap* website. Go to **mapofChengdu.xml** for more information.
- *Easyx*
  - [Website](https://easyx.cn/)
  - I used *Easyx* to draw the map and the window. Light-weight, convenient and efficient to use.
- *Pugixml*
  - [Website](https://pugixml.org/)
  - Also a light-weight, fast and portable c++ library for processing XMLs.
- *Visual Studio 2022*
