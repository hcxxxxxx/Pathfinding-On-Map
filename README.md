# Pathfinding On Map

## Brief Introduction
- This is a project concentrated mainly on pathfinding algorithms on a map, including Dijkstra & A*, as well as the implementation of Welsh-Powell graph coloring algorithm on a map.
## Background
- The project is completed as the final course project of the *Data Structure-2023 Fall* course in Computer Science, Fudan University.
- We aimed to compare different algorithms on pathfinding, including the famous *Dijkstra Algorithm*, and the more-efficient *A-Star Algorithm*. Moreover, I implemented the *Welsh-Powell Algorithm* for graph coloring as the recommendation of shelters on a map.
- Given the light-weight tools used, the limited time & ability, the work might not be highly efficient, reliable & meaningful.

## Tools
- *OpenStreetMap*
  - [Website](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
  - Nearly all the city/nodes/ways information is downloaded from the *OpenStreetMap* website. Go to **mapofChengdu.xml** for more information.
- *Easyx*
  - [Website](https://easyx.cn/)
  - I used *Easyx* to draw the map and the window. Light-weight, convenient and efficient to use.
- *Pugixml*
  - [Website](https://pugixml.org/)
  - Also a light-weight, fast and portable c++ library for processing XMLs.
- *Visual Studio 2022*

## Functions
- Pathfinding Algo. for navigation.
- Graph coloring Algo. for shelters recommendation.
- The basic function of drawing, view changing and information display on a map(I chose the map of Chengdu, which is my hometown).
- Add your own shelter on the map!!
- Check **Manual.pdf** (Chinese version) and **PJ_Help.cpp** (English version), function **Help()** specifically, for more help.
